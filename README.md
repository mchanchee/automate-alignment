# automate-alignment
This project enables:
1. The generation of .lab files from .docx files whose paragraphs match the audio recordings to be used for forced alignment on the [Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA)](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
2. The generation of a G2P dictionary for words not stored in the original dictionary.
3. The merging of multiple G2P dictionaries to obtain a broader one.

I've worked on this project as a Research Assistant under [Dr Fatima Hamlaoui](https://www.french.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/fatima-hamlaoui) at the University of Toronto from June to August 2018.
